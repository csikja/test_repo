The state vector for all $t\in\mathbf{R}$ is $x(t)\in\mathbf{R}^2$ and it satisfies the equation
\begin{equation}
\dot x(t) = A x(t).
\end{equation}

The solution of this equation has a simple form:
\begin{equation}
x(t) = c \exp(A t).
\end{equation}
The only task remained is to put a meaning into this form.
